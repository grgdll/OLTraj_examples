# OLTraj examples
These are two practical examples to help new user understand how to use the OLTraj product.

To work with these examples you first download the data, which requires you to register to CEDA if you want to use the FTP. You can register here: https://services.ceda.ac.uk/cedasite/register/info/
You can also download data from CEDA without registering, if you use the http service. You can download OLTraj data for these examples from here https://data.ceda.ac.uk/neodc/oltraj/data/v2.0

## Example 1: Extracting and plotting Lagrangian trajectories over cruise track
The first example demonstrates how to extract and plot Lagrangian trajectories along a cruise track.

To make this example work you will need the following OLTraj files:

* 20171021_oltraj_uv_global.nc  
* 20171024_oltraj_uv_global.nc  
* 20171028_oltraj_uv_global.nc
* 20171022_oltraj_uv_global.nc
* 20171026_oltraj_uv_global.nc
* 20171030_oltraj_uv_global.nc 

Then you will need to clone the GitHub repository onto your computer. You can do that using the following command: `git@github.com:grgdll/OLTraj_examples.git>`
